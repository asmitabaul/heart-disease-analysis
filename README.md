Heart Disease Analysis using Python (UCI Dataset)
# Heart Disease Analysis using Python

This project analyzes the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** using Python to understand key factors that influence heart disease.  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of medical attributes related to heart health.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify correlations between patient health indicators — such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type — and the likelihood of heart disease.

### Key Steps:
1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
2. Handling Missing Values  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Correlation Heatmap  
5. Interpretation of Results

## 🧠 Libraries Used
- **Pandas** → for data handling  
- **NumPy** → for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → for data visualization

## 🧾 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Dataset Name:** Heart Disease Dataset  
- **Attributes:** Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Cholesterol, Resting BP, Thalassemia, etc.  
- **Target Variable:** `num` (presence of heart disease)

---

## 📈 Results
The analysis revealed strong correlations between:
- Chest pain type (`cp`)
- ST depression (`oldpeak`)
- Exercise-induced angina (`exang`)
- and the presence of heart disease.
